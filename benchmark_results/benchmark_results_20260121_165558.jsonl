Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing various types of input text. This dataset should include both positive and negative sentiment labels.\n\n2. Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing any irrelevant or noisy words, converting all text into lowercase, and tokenizing it into individual words or phrases.\n\n3. Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features that can be used for analysis. Common methods for feature extraction include bag-of-words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.\n\n4. Sentiment Analysis: Use a machine learning model to classify each input sentence as positive, negative, or neutral based on the extracted features. This can be done using various algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks.\n\n5. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your sentiment analysis model by comparing its predictions with the actual sentiments in the dataset. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's effectiveness.\n\n6.

However, it also needs to manage memory allocation and deallocation, which can lead to performance issues if not managed properly.\n\nTo optimize memory management using Java's garbage collector, you should follow these best practices:\n\n1. Use appropriate data structures: Choose the right data structure for your application based on its characteristics. For example, use arrays or linked lists when dealing with large amounts of data and objects that are frequently accessed. Use trees or graphs when dealing with complex relationships between elements.\n\n2. Avoid unnecessary object creation: Try to minimize the number of objects created in your application by using appropriate design patterns and avoiding unnecessary object creation. This can be achieved by using interfaces, abstract classes, and other design patterns.\n\n3. Use reference counting: Instead of directly allocating memory for each object, use a reference counter to keep track of how many references are currently pointing to the same object. When an object is no longer needed, it should be removed from the reference counter. This can help to reduce memory fragmentation and improve garbage collection efficiency.\n\n4.

The middleware should be designed to check if the user is authenticated and, if not, redirect them to the login page.\n\nYour task is to implement the custom middleware and ensure that it is applied to the '/checkout' route, allowing only authenticated users to access it.", "prompt_char_length": 875, "prompt_estimated_tokens": 218, "prompt_length_category": "long", "error": null, "response": "```php\n// Import necessary packages\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Auth;\n\nclass AuthenticatedCheckoutMiddleware {\n    public function handle($request, Closure $next) {\n        // Check if the user is authenticated before proceeding\n        if (Auth::check()) {\n            return $next($request);\n        } else {\n            // Redirect to the login page if the user is not authenticated\n            return redirect('/login')->with('error', 'You are not authorized to access this route.');\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage in a Laravel application\nuse App\\Http\\Controllers\\CheckoutController;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Auth;\n\nclass CheckoutApp {\n    public function __construct() {\n        Auth::routes();\n        \n        // Apply the custom middleware to the '/checkout' route\n        $this->middleware('auth:checkout')->handle(function ($request) {\n            return $request->validate([\n                'name' => 'required|string|max:255',\n                'email' => 'required|email|max:255|unique:users',\n                'password' => 'required|string|min:8'\n            ]);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage in a Laravel application\n$app = require __DIR__ .

Let's break down the key aspects and provide some guidance.\n\n### What is an AVL Tree?\n\nAn **AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance through rotations. It is designed to be efficient in operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.\n\n### Key Features of an AVL Tree\n\n1. **Balance Factor**: The height difference between the left and right subtrees should not exceed 1.\n2. **Rotation Rules**:\n   - Left rotation: Swap the heights of the two children and rotate to the left child.\n   - Right rotation: Swap the heights of the two children and rotate to the right child.\n   - Zigzag Rotation: Rotate around a common ancestor, which is either the root or one of its children.\n\n### Balancing an AVL Tree\n\nBalancing an AVL tree involves several steps:\n\n1. **Find the Balance Factor**: Calculate the balance factor for each node in the tree.\n2. **Rotate to Balance**: Depending on the balance factor, perform left rotation, right rotation, or zigzag rotation to restore balance.\n3. **Rebalance**:", "e2e_latency": 3.727405548095703, "ttft": 0.09906510000000002, "itl": 0.005019987450980393, "ttft_measured": 3.726898431777954, "itl_measured": 1.9886914421530332e-06, "tpot": 0.005000378125000001, "throughput": 199.98487614374162, "output_tokens": 256, "prompt_processing_time": 0.012856000000000001, "generation_time": 1.2800968000000001, "ollama_total_duration": 1.6534501000000001, "ollama_load_duration": 0.08620910000000001, "ollama_prompt_eval_count": 94, "ollama_prompt_eval_duration": 0.012856000000000001, "ollama_eval_count": 256, "ollama_eval_duration": 1.2800968000000001}

The turn and depth change should also affect the position and intensity of the reflection.\n\nThe SVG markup should also include a background scene of a detailed coral reef ecosystem, including a variety of corals, aquatic plants, and a shining sun, and the organisms should swim across this environment. The environment should also be affected by the changing light source and current, with their reflections and shapes altering accordingly.\n\nThe organisms should vanish when they reach a certain distance, with the tail disappearing last. The disappearing should be realistic, with the inside of the coral and aquatic plants revealed. The organisms should also persist in changing color and casting reflections in accordance with the light source.\n\nThe second, third, fourth, and fifth organisms should swim a few seconds after the first one, each following a different path and affected by different current conditions. The organisms should interact with each other and the environment if they come into contact while swimming or after disappearing.\n\nThe SVG markup and animation should be created using only JavaScript and SVG, without any external libraries or tools. The code should be well-commented and easy to comprehend, and should adhere to best practices for performance and readability.\n\nIn addition, the code should also include a user interface that allows users to control the speed, direction, and color of the organisms, as well as the intensity and direction of the current. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, and should also be created using only JavaScript and SVG.\n\nFurthermore, the user interface should allow users to add or remove organisms mid-animation, and the code should dynamically adjust the animation and interactions accordingly. The organisms should also emit a trail as they swim, with the trail's color and intensity changing in accordance with the organisms' color and speed.\n\nMoreover, the user interface should allow users to control the time of day, altering the lighting conditions and color palette of the scene. The organisms should also respond to user input, altering their swimming patterns and behaviors in real-time. The user interface should also allow users to add or remove obstacles in the environment, and the organisms should dynamically adjust their swimming patterns to evade these obstacles.\n\nAdditionally, the SVG markup should include a predator shark that follows the school of organisms, with its speed and direction influenced by the movement of the school. The predator shark should also react to the user's input, altering its hunting patterns and behaviors in real-time.\n\nTo increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the food chain, with smaller organisms being eaten by larger organisms. The organisms should exhibit realistic behaviors when hunting or being hunted, such as fear, aggression, and evasion. The code should also simulate the life cycle of the organisms, with organisms growing larger over time, reproducing, and eventually dying. The user interface should allow users to control the population size, growth rate, and lifespan of the organisms. The code should also include a simulation of the ecosystem, with the health of the environment affecting the health and behavior of the organisms.\n\nTo further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of underwater sounds on the behavior of the organisms. The code should simulate the effects of sounds produced by other marine animals, human activities, and natural phenomena on the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as fear, curiosity, and aggression in response to these sounds. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the sounds, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in sound. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of light on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as attraction, repulsion, and confusion in response to different colors and intensities of light. The user interface should allow users to control the color and intensity of the light, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in light.\n\nTo further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of water conditions on the behavior of the organisms. The code should simulate the effects of water conditions such as temperature, salinity, and pH on the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as seeking shelter, slowing down, or becoming more active in response to these conditions. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the water conditions, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in water conditions. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of pollutants on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as sickness, decreased activity, and death in response to these pollutants. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the pollutants, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in pollution. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of conservation efforts on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as increased health and activity in response to these efforts. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the conservation efforts, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in conservation efforts.\n\nTo further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of water conditions on the behavior of the organisms.

The key point here is that it requires all executable memory areas to be unmapped.\nTo achieve this without unmapping the area where the program itself is running, you can use the `prctl` system call instead of `PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE`. The `prctl` system call allows you to set a process's control parameters, including setting the file descriptor for the executable memory areas.\nHere's an example of how you could use `prctl` to achieve this:\n```bash\nprctl -n \"set_executable\" 0x1234567890abcdef\n```\n\nIn this command, `-n` is used to set a process's control parameter. The value `\"set_executable\"` specifies that the file should be executable.\nNote that `prctl` requires root privileges to work properly. If you don't have root privileges, you'll need to use `sudo`.\nAlso, keep in mind that using `prctl` can potentially cause issues if not used carefully, as it modifies the process's control parameters and may affect other system services or processes.\nI hope this helps!

The graph has the following properties:\nThere are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).\n\nThere are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).\n\nIf `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).\n\nThe graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.\n\nA graph is a tree if it is connected and there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n\nReturn `true` if and only if it is a tree.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There is more than one path between nodes 0 and 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: graph = [[1,2],[0,2],[0,1]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The graph is connected and there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`graph.length == n`\n`1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100`\n`0 &lt;= graph[u].length &lt; n`\n`0 &lt;= graph[u][i] &lt;= n - 1`\n`graph[u]` does not contain `u`.\n\nAll the values of `graph[u]` are unique.\n\nIf `graph[u]` contains `v`, then `graph[v]` contains `u`.", "prompt_char_length": 1417, "prompt_estimated_tokens": 354, "prompt_length_category": "very_long", "error": null, "response": "def isTree(graph):\n    def dfs(node, parent):\n        visited.add(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor == parent:\n                continue\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                return False\n            if len(visited) > 1:\n                return False\n            if not dfs(neighbor, node):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    n = len(graph)\n    visited = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i not in visited:\n            if not dfs(i, -1):\n                return False\n    return len(visited) == n", "e2e_latency": 3.8317337036132812, "ttft": 0.1472712, "itl": 0.012403298347107438, "ttft_measured": 3.8312253952026367, "itl_measured": 4.23590342203776e-06, "tpot": 0.012301631967213116, "throughput": 81.29002742605589, "output_tokens": 122, "prompt_processing_time": 0.0387272, "generation_time": 1.5007991, "ollama_total_duration": 1.7693422, "ollama_load_duration": 0.108544, "ollama_prompt_eval_count": 452, "ollama_prompt_eval_duration": 0.0387272, "ollama_eval_count": 122, "ollama_eval_duration": 1.5007991}

The organisms should display behaviors such as darting, rotating, and modulating their depth in a probabilistic manner, and then proceed to swim. The animation should mirror reality, taking into account factors like aquatic currents, gravitational pull, marine biodiversity, and obstructions in the habitat such as corals and aquatic plants.\n\nThe marine organisms should transition their pigmentation from cerulean to emerald and then to violet as they swim, simulating the effect of sunlight penetrating through the water surface. The color transition should be gradual and lifelike. The reflections of the organisms should also modify in accordance with the position of a simulated moving light source.\n\nIncorporate a current effect that influences the swimming trajectory of the organisms. The current should be represented as a variable force, causing the organisms to sway left and right, and up and down as they swim. The strength, direction, and depth of the current should fluctuate over time, and this should be reflected in the organisms' movement.\n\nThe SVG markup should be optimized for performance and should function across all contemporary web browsers. Provide a piece of erroneous code that attempts to create the SVG markup and animation. Identify and rectify the errors in the code, and elucidate why the original code was incorrect.\n\nThe organisms should also turn and modulate their depth as they swim, with the turn speed, direction, and depth change being random over time to simulate the effect of water turbulence. The turn and depth change should also affect the position and intensity of the reflection.\n\nThe SVG markup should also include a background scene of a detailed coral reef ecosystem, including a variety of corals, aquatic plants, and a shining sun, and the organisms should swim across this environment. The environment should also be affected by the changing light source and current, with their reflections and shapes altering accordingly.\n\nThe organisms should vanish when they reach a certain distance, with the tail disappearing last. The disappearing should be realistic, with the inside of the coral and aquatic plants revealed. The organisms should also persist in changing color and casting reflections in accordance with the light source.\n\nThe second, third, fourth, and fifth organisms should swim a few seconds after the first one, each following a different path and affected by different current conditions. The organisms should interact with each other and the environment if they come into contact while swimming or after disappearing.\n\nThe SVG markup and animation should be created using only JavaScript and SVG, without any external libraries or tools. The code should be well-commented and easy to comprehend, and should adhere to best practices for performance and readability.\n\nIn addition, the code should also include a user interface that allows users to control the speed, direction, and color of the organisms, as well as the intensity and direction of the current. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, and should also be created using only JavaScript and SVG.\n\nFurthermore, the user interface should allow users to add or remove organisms mid-animation, and the code should dynamically adjust the animation and interactions accordingly. The organisms should also emit a trail as they swim, with the trail's color and intensity changing in accordance with the organisms' color and speed.\n\nMoreover, the user interface should allow users to control the time of day, altering the lighting conditions and color palette of the scene. The organisms should also respond to user input, altering their swimming patterns and behaviors in real-time. The user interface should also allow users to add or remove obstacles in the environment, and the organisms should dynamically adjust their swimming patterns to evade these obstacles.\n\nAdditionally, the SVG markup should include a predator shark that follows the school of organisms, with its speed and direction influenced by the movement of the school. The predator shark should also react to the user's input, altering its hunting patterns and behaviors in real-time.\n\nTo increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the food chain, with smaller organisms being eaten by larger organisms. The organisms should exhibit realistic behaviors when hunting or being hunted, such as fear, aggression, and evasion. The code should also simulate the life cycle of the organisms, with organisms growing larger over time, reproducing, and eventually dying. The user interface should allow users to control the population size, growth rate, and lifespan of the organisms. The code should also include a simulation of the ecosystem, with the health of the environment affecting the health and behavior of the organisms.\n\nTo further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of underwater sounds on the behavior of the organisms. The code should simulate the effects of sounds produced by other marine animals, human activities, and natural phenomena on the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as fear, curiosity, and aggression in response to these sounds.

The organisms should display behaviors such as darting, rotating, and modulating their depth in a probabilistic manner, and then proceed to swim. The animation should mirror reality, taking into account factors like aquatic currents, gravitational pull, marine biodiversity, and obstructions in the habitat such as corals and aquatic plants.\n\nThe marine organisms should transition their pigmentation from cerulean to emerald and then to violet as they swim, simulating the effect of sunlight penetrating through the water surface. The color transition should be gradual and lifelike. The reflections of the organisms should also modify in accordance with the position of a simulated moving light source.\n\nIncorporate a current effect that influences the swimming trajectory of the organisms.

The strength, direction, and depth of the current should fluctuate over time, and this should be reflected in the organisms' movement.\n\nThe SVG markup should be optimized for performance and should function across all contemporary web browsers. Provide a piece of erroneous code that attempts to create the SVG markup and animation. Identify and rectify the errors in the code, and elucidate why the original code was incorrect.\n\nThe organisms should also turn and modulate their depth as they swim, with the turn speed, direction, and depth change being random over time to simulate the effect of water turbulence.

And you want to do it in such a manner $min_{i \\neq j}$ (shortest distance between $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ ), is maximized.\n\n------ Input: ------\n\nFirst line of the input contains a pair of integers $M$ and $N$.\nThe i-th of the next $N$ lines contains two numbers $L_{i}$ and $R_{i}$ which denote the end points of the i-th interval.\n\n------ Output: ------\nA single integer denoting the maximized minimum distance between any two marked numbers.\n\n------ Constraints  ------\n$1 ≤ M ≤ 10^{18}$\n$2 ≤ N ≤ 4 * 10^{5}$\n\n------ Subtasks ------\n10 points : \n\t- $1 ≤ M ≤ 10000$\n\t- $2 ≤ N ≤ 100$\n25 points : \n\t- $1 ≤ M ≤ 10^{18}$\n\t- $2 ≤ N ≤ 1000$\n65 points : No further constraints.\n\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \n9 3\n0 2\n3 4\n5 7\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \n3\n----- explanation 1 ------ \nWe can choose $A_{1} = 0, A_{2} = 3, A_{3} = 6$. The distance between every adjacent marked pair of numbers is 3, and hence that is the minimum.

For cloud-based applications, G1 Garbage Collector is often recommended due to its ability to handle large heaps and pause times effectively. Other options include Shenandoah, Zing, or customizing the default HotSpot GC based on your specific use case.\n\n2. **Heap Size Configuration:** Properly configure the heap size for your application. A larger heap may lead to better performance for memory-intensive applications but can also increase garbage collection pauses. Conversely, a smaller heap might result in more frequent collections and potential performance issues.

The organisms should display behaviors such as darting, rotating, and modulating their depth in a probabilistic manner, and then proceed to swim. The animation should mirror reality, taking into account factors like aquatic currents, gravitational pull, marine biodiversity, and obstructions in the habitat such as corals and aquatic plants.\n\nThe marine organisms should transition their pigmentation from cerulean to emerald and then to violet as they swim, simulating the effect of sunlight penetrating through the water surface. The color transition should be gradual and lifelike. The reflections of the organisms should also modify in accordance with the position of a simulated moving light source.\n\nIncorporate a current effect that influences the swimming trajectory of the organisms. The current should be represented as a variable force, causing the organisms to sway left and right, and up and down as they swim. The strength, direction, and depth of the current should fluctuate over time, and this should be reflected in the organisms' movement.\n\nThe SVG markup should be optimized for performance and should function across all contemporary web browsers. Provide a piece of erroneous code that attempts to create the SVG markup and animation. Identify and rectify the errors in the code, and elucidate why the original code was incorrect.\n\nThe organisms should also turn and modulate their depth as they swim, with the turn speed, direction, and depth change being random over time to simulate the effect of water turbulence. The turn and depth change should also affect the position and intensity of the reflection.\n\nThe SVG markup should also include a background scene of a detailed coral reef ecosystem, including a variety of corals, aquatic plants, and a shining sun, and the organisms should swim across this environment. The environment should also be affected by the changing light source and current, with their reflections and shapes altering accordingly.\n\nThe organisms should vanish when they reach a certain distance, with the tail disappearing last. The disappearing should be realistic, with the inside of the coral and aquatic plants revealed. The organisms should also persist in changing color and casting reflections in accordance with the light source.\n\nThe second, third, fourth, and fifth organisms should swim a few seconds after the first one, each following a different path and affected by different current conditions.

The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, and should also be created using only JavaScript and SVG.\n\nFurthermore, the user interface should allow users to add or remove organisms mid-animation, and the code should dynamically adjust the animation and interactions accordingly. The organisms should also emit a trail as they swim, with the trail's color and intensity changing in accordance with the organisms' color and speed.\n\nMoreover, the user interface should allow users to control the time of day, altering the lighting conditions and color palette of the scene. The organisms should also respond to user input, altering their swimming patterns and behaviors in real-time. The user interface should also allow users to add or remove obstacles in the environment, and the organisms should dynamically adjust their swimming patterns to evade these obstacles.\n\nAdditionally, the SVG markup should include a predator shark that follows the school of organisms, with its speed and direction influenced by the movement of the school. The predator shark should also react to the user's input, altering its hunting patterns and behaviors in real-time.\n\nTo increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the food chain, with smaller organisms being eaten by larger organisms. The organisms should exhibit realistic behaviors when hunting or being hunted, such as fear, aggression, and evasion.

The code should simulate the effects of sounds produced by other marine animals, human activities, and natural phenomena on the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as fear, curiosity, and aggression in response to these sounds. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the sounds, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in sound. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of light on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as attraction, repulsion, and confusion in response to different colors and intensities of light. The user interface should allow users to control the color and intensity of the light, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in light.\n\nTo further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of water conditions on the behavior of the organisms. The code should simulate the effects of water conditions such as temperature, salinity, and pH on the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as seeking shelter, slowing down, or becoming more active in response to these conditions. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the water conditions, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in water conditions. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of pollutants on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as sickness, decreased activity, and death in response to these pollutants. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the pollutants, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in pollution.

The output will be:\n\n```\n*\n**\n***\n****\n*****\n```", "e2e_latency": 7.427819013595581, "ttft": 0.0704212, "itl": 0.020299035433070867, "ttft_measured": 7.4273130893707275, "itl_measured": 1.9997004934921567e-06, "tpot": 0.020219431372549022, "throughput": 49.45737501587969, "output_tokens": 255, "prompt_processing_time": 0.054209, "generation_time": 5.1559550000000005, "ollama_total_duration": 5.343696100000001, "ollama_load_duration": 0.0162122, "ollama_prompt_eval_count": 14, "ollama_prompt_eval_duration": 0.054209, "ollama_eval_count": 255, "ollama_eval_duration": 5.1559550000000005}

Preprocessing: First, ensure that your data is clean and ready for analysis. This might involve handling missing values, outliers, or scaling the features if necessary.\n\n2. Split the Data: Divide your dataset into training and testing sets. A common split is 70% for training and 30% for testing.\n\n3. Feature Scaling (Optional): If your data contains features with different scales, it's a good idea to scale them before training the SVM.
