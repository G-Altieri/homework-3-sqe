Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing various types of input text. This dataset should include both positive and negative sentiment labels.\n\n2. Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing any irrelevant or noisy words, converting all text into lowercase, and tokenizing it into individual words or phrases.\n\n3. Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features that can be used for analysis. Common methods for feature extraction include bag-of-words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.\n\n4. Sentiment Analysis: Use a machine learning model to classify each input sentence as positive, negative, or neutral based on the extracted features. This can be done using various algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks.\n\n5. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your sentiment analysis model by comparing its predictions with the actual sentiments in the dataset. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's effectiveness.\n\n6.

The `isHypoValid` function is used to check the validity of a hypothesis, and `genMatchSumDR` is a variable representing the sum of delta R values for gen-matched particles.\n\nYour task is to implement the logic for the `isHypoValid` function and define the cut criteria based on the given context.\n\nWrite a function in Python that takes the `isHypoValid` condition and the `genMatchSumDR` value as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the event passes the cut criteria.", "prompt_char_length": 1011, "prompt_estimated_tokens": 252, "prompt_length_category": "very_long", "error": null, "response": "def is_hypo_valid(condition, gen_match_sum_dr):\n    # Implement your logic here\n    return True  # Replace with actual implementation\n\n# Define the cut criteria based on the given context\ncut_criteria = \"genMatchSumDR > 0.5\"\n\n# Create a dictionary to store the conditions and their corresponding values\nconditions = {\n    \"genMatchSumDR\": gen_match_sum_dr,\n}\n\n# Use the is_hypo_valid function with the defined condition and value\ndef apply_cut(condition, gen_match_sum_dr):\n    return is_hypo_valid(condition, gen_match_sum_dr)\n\n# Apply the cut criteria to the event\nif apply_cut(cut_criteria, conditions[\"genMatchSumDR\"]):\n    print(\"Event passes the cut criteria\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Event fails the cut criteria\")", "e2e_latency": 4.270728826522827, "ttft": 0.1360391, "itl": 0.01168814484848485, "ttft_measured": 4.270215034484863, "itl_measured": 3.132878280267483e-06, "tpot": 0.0116177343373494, "throughput": 85.55677679932512, "output_tokens": 165, "prompt_processing_time": 0.0320557, "generation_time": 1.9285439000000002, "ollama_total_duration": 2.2357184, "ollama_load_duration": 0.1039834, "ollama_prompt_eval_count": 239, "ollama_prompt_eval_duration": 0.0320557, "ollama_eval_count": 166, "ollama_eval_duration": 1.9285439000000002}
