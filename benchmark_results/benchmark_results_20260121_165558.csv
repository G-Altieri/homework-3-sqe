Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing various types of input text. This dataset should include both positive and negative sentiment labels.

2. Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing any irrelevant or noisy words, converting all text into lowercase, and tokenizing it into individual words or phrases.

3. Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features that can be used for analysis. Common methods for feature extraction include bag-of-words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.

4. Sentiment Analysis: Use a machine learning model to classify each input sentence as positive, negative, or neutral based on the extracted features. This can be done using various algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your sentiment analysis model by comparing its predictions with the actual sentiments in the dataset. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's effectiveness.

1. **Understanding SVG Gradients**: Before diving into the specifics of SVG gradients, it's important to understand what they are and how they work.

2. **RadialGradient, LinearGradient, and SpreadMethod**: These are three types of SVG gradients that can be used for different purposes:
   - **RadialGradient**: Used for circular shapes.
   - **LinearGradient**: Used for linear paths or horizontal lines.
   - **SpreadMethod**: Determines how the gradient is spread across its path.

3. **Manipulating Attributes**: To manipulate these attributes, we need to use JavaScript and SVG APIs.

4. **Creating Advanced Visual Effects with Multiple Gradients**: This involves combining multiple gradients into a single element and using CSS properties like `transform` and `filter`.

5. **Creating Patterns with SVG Patterns**: Using patterns can be done by creating an SVG pattern and then applying it to the canvas or other elements.

6. **Optimizing Complex SVG Elements**: Techniques such as aspectRatio, viewBox, and media queries can help manage complex SVG elements efficiently.

The GC helps to free up memory that has been allocated by the application and can be reused later on. However, it also needs to manage memory allocation and deallocation, which can lead to performance issues if not managed properly.

To optimize memory management using Java's garbage collector, you should follow these best practices:

1. Use appropriate data structures: Choose the right data structure for your application based on its characteristics. For example, use arrays or linked lists when dealing with large amounts of data and objects that are frequently accessed. Use trees or graphs when dealing with complex relationships between elements.

2. Avoid unnecessary object creation: Try to minimize the number of objects created in your application by using appropriate design patterns and avoiding unnecessary object creation. This can be achieved by using interfaces, abstract classes, and other design patterns.

3. Use reference counting: Instead of directly allocating memory for each object, use a reference counter to keep track of how many references are currently pointing to the same object. When an object is no longer needed, it should be removed from the reference counter. This can help to reduce memory fragmentation and improve garbage collection efficiency.

4. Use automatic memory management: Java's garbage collector automatically",3.7788503170013428,0.1681219,0.004951976862745098,3.7788503170013428,0.0,0.004932633203125,202.73147400590503,256,0.0812157,1.2627541,1.710687,0.0869062,52,0.0812157,256,1.2627541

Here's an explanation of each part of this regex:

- `\b`: Matches a word boundary, ensuring that we are not matching within words.
- `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]`: Matches one or more characters that are either letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens. This part is used to match the domain name part of an email address.
- `@`: Matches the literal ""@"" symbol.
- `[A-Za-z0-9.-]+`: Matches one or more characters that are either letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, dots, or hyphens. This part is used to match the username part of an email address.
- `\.`: Matches a literal dot character.
- `[A-Z]{1,3}`: Matches exactly three alphabetic characters. The `A-Z` range ensures that we are matching at least one uppercase letter in the domain name.

The middleware system is responsible for authenticating users before they can access certain routes. In Laravel, middleware can be applied to routes to filter HTTP requests entering the application. When a user tries to access a route that has the 'auth' middleware applied, the system should check if the user is authenticated before allowing access.

Given the code snippet provided, you need to create a custom middleware in Laravel that authenticates users before they can access the '/checkout' route. The middleware should be designed to check if the user is authenticated and, if not, redirect them to the login page.

Your task is to implement the custom middleware and ensure that it is applied to the '/checkout' route, allowing only authenticated users to access it.",875,218,long,,"```php
// Import necessary packages
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class AuthenticatedCheckoutMiddleware {
    public function handle($request, $view) {

            // Redirect to the login page if not authenticated

1. Create the custom middleware class:
```php
// Define the custom middleware class
class AuthenticatedCheckoutMiddleware {
    public function handle($request, $view) {
        // Check if the user is authenticated
        if (Auth::check()) {

            return redirect('/login');
        } else {
            // Allow access for authenticated users
            return view($view);
        }
    }
}
```

2. Apply the custom middleware to a specific route:

The provided code snippet is a part of a Python module for importing CIPRS records. The function `import_ciprs_records` takes three parameters: `files`, `user`, and `parser_mode`. The `files` parameter is a list of files containing CIPRS records to be imported. The `user` parameter represents the user initiating the import process, and the `parser_mode` parameter specifies the mode for parsing the CIPRS documents.

Your task is to create a Python function that utilizes the provided code snippet and implements the `import_ciprs_records` function. The function should handle the import of CIPRS records from the given files, using the specified parser mode, and log any relevant information using the `logger` object.

Your function should:
- Accept the same parameters as the original `import_ciprs_records` function.
- Implement the import logic for CIPRS records from the provided files.
- Utilize the `parse_ciprs_document` function from the `dear_petition.petition.etl.extract` module to parse the CIPRS documents.
- Use the `petition_offense_records` and `identify_distinct_petitions` functions from the `dear_petition.petition.types` module to process the parsed CIPRS records.
- Log relevant information using the `logger` object from the `logging` module.

qwen2.5:0.5b,13,3,2026-01-21T14:42:10.606453,"I have this problem : Is Graph a Tree?
Description are as below: There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:
There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).

There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).

If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).

The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is a tree if it is connected and there is exactly one path between any two nodes.

Return `true` if and only if it is a tree.


Example 1:
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is more than one path between nodes 0 and 2.


Example 2:
Input: graph = [[1,2],[0,2],[0,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: The graph is connected and there is exactly one path between any two nodes.


Constraints:
`graph.length == n`
`1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100`
`0 &lt;= graph[u].length &lt; n`
`0 &lt;= graph[u][i] &lt;= n - 1`

3. Inside the loop, print the current value of `i` cubed using `i ** 3`.
4. Increment `i` by 4 in each iteration.

Let's break down the code:

- The variable `i` starts at 4 and increases by 4 with each iteration (i.e., `i = i + 4`).
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 16.
- Inside the loop, `i ** 3` calculates the cube of `i`, which is then printed using `print(i ** 3)`.

Here's a summary of what happens in each iteration:

- After the first iteration (`i = 4`), `i` becomes 8 (since `i + 4 = 12`).

1. Challenge 1: You need to determine the 5 terms of a geometric progression where the sum is 300 and the common ratio is 3. But there's a catch. You can't use any loops (for, while, do-while) for this challenge. Your task is to solve this problem with recursive functions only.

2. Challenge 2: Extend Challenge 1. Now, the user can set an arbitrary sum and an arbitrary common ratio. The user also has the flexibility to specify the number of terms in the geometric progression. Handle exceptions where an improper ratio or term number is entered by a user.

No loops are allowed and exception handling must be implemented. Your solution should be optimized in time and space complexity.",785,196,long,,"To solve these challenges, we'll use Python's `math` module to handle the calculations efficiently. The key steps involve defining recursive functions for calculating terms of the geometric progression and then using a loop or recursion to find the sum.

def geometric_progression_sum(a, r, n):
    if n == 0:

r = 3  # Common ratio
n = 5  # Number of terms

Can you guys help me on this?",267,66,medium,,"Certainly! Implementing an AVL tree is indeed quite challenging, but it can be approached with some careful planning and understanding of its properties. Let's break down the key aspects:

### 1. **Understanding AVL Trees**
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node's height difference between its left subtree and right subtree is at most one. This property ensures that operations like `insert`, `delete`, and `search` are efficient.

### 2. **Balancing the Tree**
To balance an AVL tree, you need to perform rotations (left rotation, right rotation) on nodes as necessary. The goal is to maintain the height difference between the left and right subtrees of each node within a certain tolerance level.

### 3. **Balancing the Tree with Insertion**
- **Inserting a Node**: When inserting a new node into an AVL tree, you need to balance it by performing rotations.
- **Rotation Types**:
  - Left rotation: Rotate the current node's left child down so that its height is now at least as large as its right subtree.
  - Right rotation: Rotate the current node's right child up so that its height is now at most as large as its left subtree.

### What is an AVL Tree?

An **AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance through rotations. It is designed to be efficient in operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

### Key Features of an AVL Tree

1. **Balance Factor**: The height difference between the left and right subtrees should not exceed 1.
2. **Rotation Rules**:
   - Left rotation: Swap the heights of the two children and rotate to the left child.
   - Right rotation: Swap the heights of the two children and rotate to the right child.
   - Zigzag Rotation: Rotate around a common ancestor, which is either the root or one of its children.

### Balancing an AVL Tree

Balancing an AVL tree involves several steps:

1. **Find the Balance Factor**: Calculate the balance factor for each node in the tree.
2. **Rotate to Balance**: Depending on the balance factor, perform left rotation, right rotation, or zigzag rotation to restore balance.

The function should check if the dictionary adheres to the specified rules and return a boolean value indicating whether the validation was successful or not.

The validation rules are defined as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a validation rule. Each rule dictionary contains the following keys:
- 'name': The name of the field to be validated.
- 'description': A description of the field.
- 'in': The location of the field in the input data (e.g., 'formData', 'json', 'query').
- 'type': The expected data type of the field (e.g., 'str', 'int', 'bool').

Your task is to implement the function `validate_data(data, rules)` where:
- data: A dictionary representing the input data to be validated.
- rules: A list of dictionaries representing the validation rules.

The function should return True if the input data adheres to all the specified rules, and False otherwise.

```
data = {

  - The price of the product is greater than 100.
  - The product is currently in stock.
  - The product category is ""Electronics"".
- `select p` converts each filtered product to a new entity (`p`) that can be used for further processing.

Illustrate your explanation with a suitable programming example.,132,33,short,,"A ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement in programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. It allows you to evaluate one condition and execute a block of code based on that condition. The syntax for a ternary operator is:

```python
result = expression1 if condition else expression2
```

In this example, `expression1` will be evaluated first, followed by the conditional part (`if condition`). If the condition evaluates to true, then `expression1` will be assigned the value of that expression. Otherwise, it will assign the value of `expression2`.

Let's illustrate this with a suitable programming example:

```python
def recursive_function(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        # Recursive call to the function with n-1
        result = recursive_function(n - 1)
        return result + n

# Example usage of the function
n = 5
result = recursive_function(n)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

Illustrate your explanation with a suitable programming example.,132,33,short,,"A ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement in programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. It allows you to evaluate one of two expressions based on the truth value of another expression.

In the context of a recursive method, a ternary operator can be used to control the flow of execution within the method. Here's how it works:

1. **Expression**: The expression is evaluated first.
2. **Conditional Logic**: If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the if block is executed; otherwise, the code inside the else block is executed.

Let's illustrate this with a suitable programming example in Python:

```python
def recursive_function(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0, return 1 (factorial of 0)
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive case: calculate factorial using ternary operator
    result = n * recursive_function(n - 1)
    
    return result

1. **Remove Duplicates**: First, remove any duplicate characters from the input string.

2. **Sort Characters**: Sort the remaining characters in alphabetical order.

3. **Check Palindrome Condition**: Verify if the sorted characters form a palindrome by comparing them with their reverse.

Here's a Python implementation of this algorithm using the `collections` module:

```python
from collections import Counter

qwen2.5:0.5b,25,4,2026-01-21T14:45:48.568597,"You are tasked with implementing a class that manages permissions for a user interface in a software application. The class should handle the availability of different types of UI elements based on the user's permissions. The permissions are represented by a flags enum called `UserInterfacePermission` with the following values:
- `None` (0x0000): No permission for any UI element
- `View` (0x0001): Permission to view UI elements
- `Edit` (0x0002): Permission to edit UI elements
- `Delete` (0x0004): Permission to delete UI elements
- `All` (View | Edit | Delete): Permission for all UI elements

You need to implement a method `CheckPermission` in the `UserInterfacePermissionManager` class that takes the user's permission and the required permission for a UI element, and returns `true` if the user has the required permission, and `false` otherwise.

The `UserInterfacePermissionManager` class should have the following method:
```csharp
public class UserInterfacePermissionManager {
    public bool CheckPermission(UserInterfacePermission userPermission, UserInterfacePermission requiredPermission) {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

For example, if a user has `View` and `Edit` permissions, and the required permission for a UI element is `Edit`, the `CheckPermission` method should return `true`.

The marine organisms should transition their pigmentation from cerulean to emerald and then to violet as they swim, simulating the effect of sunlight penetrating through the water surface. The color transition should be gradual and lifelike. The reflections of the organisms should also modify in accordance with the position of a simulated moving light source.

Incorporate a current effect that influences the swimming trajectory of the organisms. The current should be represented as a variable force, causing the organisms to sway left and right, and up and down as they swim. The strength, direction, and depth of the current should fluctuate over time, and this should be reflected in the organisms' movement.

The SVG markup should be optimized for performance and should function across all contemporary web browsers. Provide a piece of erroneous code that attempts to create the SVG markup and animation. Identify and rectify the errors in the code, and elucidate why the original code was incorrect.

The organisms should also turn and modulate their depth as they swim, with the turn speed, direction, and depth change being random over time to simulate the effect of water turbulence. The turn and depth change should also affect the position and intensity of the reflection.

The SVG markup should also include a background scene of a detailed coral reef ecosystem, including a variety of corals, aquatic plants, and a shining sun, and the organisms should swim across this environment. The environment should also be affected by the changing light source and current, with their reflections and shapes altering accordingly.

The organisms should vanish when they reach a certain distance, with the tail disappearing last. The disappearing should be realistic, with the inside of the coral and aquatic plants revealed. The organisms should also persist in changing color and casting reflections in accordance with the light source.

The second, third, fourth, and fifth organisms should swim a few seconds after the first one, each following a different path and affected by different current conditions. The organisms should interact with each other and the environment if they come into contact while swimming or after disappearing.

The SVG markup and animation should be created using only JavaScript and SVG, without any external libraries or tools. The code should be well-commented and easy to comprehend, and should adhere to best practices for performance and readability.

The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the sounds, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in sound. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of light on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as attraction, repulsion, and confusion in response to different colors and intensities of light.

This means that you can add, remove, or change the values of properties in a mutable object without affecting its state. For example:
   ```python
   class Example:
       def __init__(self):
           self.name = ""Alice""
       
       def update_name(self, new_name):
           self.name = new_name

   example = Example()
   print(example.name)  # Output: Alice
   example.update_name(""Bob"")
   print(example.name)  # Output: Bob
   ```
2. **Immutable Objects**: These are objects that cannot be changed after they have been created. They do not allow for modification through methods like `update()`, `append()`, and so forth. This means that once an object is created, its properties cannot be modified or added to. For example:
   ```python
   class Example:
       def __init__(self):
           self.name = ""Alice""

   example = Example()
   print(example",3.8327460289001465,0.1711877,0.0050926258823529415,3.8322370052337646,1.9961712407130822e-06,0.0050727328125,197.132401205095,256,0.07946800000000001,1.2986196,1.7638175,0.0917197,52,0.07946800000000001,256,1.2986196

In programming, an object is considered to be either mutable or immutable based on its behavior when it comes to modifying itself.

1. **Mutable Objects**: These are objects that can be changed after they have been created. They allow for modifications such as adding new properties, changing existing properties, and even removing properties entirely. Examples of mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, and classes in Python.

2. **Immutable Objects**: These are objects that cannot be modified once they are created. They do not support the addition or removal of new properties, nor can their values be changed after creation. An example of an immutable object is a class in Python (like `class Dog:`), which does not allow adding new attributes to it.

### Key Differences:

- **Modifiability**: 
  - **Mutable Objects**: These objects are mutable and can be modified.
  - **Immutable Objects**: These objects cannot be modified once they are created, making them immutable.

- **Behavior with `=` Operator**:
  - **Mutable Objects**: When you use the assignment operator (`=`) to modify an object's properties or values, it changes the original object. For example, if you have a list and change one of its elements using `list1[0] = ""new_value",3.7735283374786377,0.0981003,0.00518085568627451,3.7735283374786377,0.0,0.0051606179687500005,193.77524282081646,256,0.0116848,1.3211182000000001,1.7023562,0.0864155,52,0.0116848,256,1.3211182000000001

Your task is to implement a function `renderHTML` that takes a string `html` as input and returns the rendered output as a string. The input `html` will consist of HTML-like tags and content, and you need to handle opening and closing tags, as well as the content within the tags.

The following rules should be followed:
- The input `html` will be a well-formed string with opening and closing tags.
- Opening tags will be denoted by `<tagname>` and closing tags by `</tagname>`.
- The content within the tags should be rendered as per the following rules:
  - The content within `<li>` tags should be prefixed with a bullet point (""•"").
  - The content within `<b>` tags should be enclosed within asterisks (""*"").
  - The content within `<i>` tags should be enclosed within underscores (""_"").

For example, given the input:
```
<html>
    <body>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Item 1</b></li>
            <li><i>Item 2</i></li>

- Then, \( B(n) = p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_k - 4 \).

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We have an interval array where each interval contains all integers from `L` to `R`. The goal is to mark exactly one number for each interval in such a way that the minimum distance between any two marked numbers is maximized.

2. **Identify the Interval with Maximum Distance**: First, identify which interval has the maximum distance (i.e., the smallest difference between its start and end points). This will be our starting point to mark the first number for this interval.

3. **Mark the Next Number**: For each subsequent interval, find the next number that is not already marked in the current interval. The next number should be chosen such that it does not overlap with any previously marked numbers in the current interval.

4. **Repeat for All Intervals**: Continue marking the next number until all intervals are processed.

5. **Calculate the Minimum Distance**: After marking all intervals, calculate the minimum distance between any two marked numbers.

The key observation here is that each interval contains all the integers between its endpoints, so the distances between consecutive intervals are simply the lengths of these intervals.

Given the constraints and the problem's requirements, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the Lengths of Intervals**: For each interval, the length \( L_i \) is given by \( R_i - L_i + 1 \). This is because the interval contains all integers from \( L_i \) to \( R_i \).

2. **Calculate Minimum Distance Between Marked Numbers**: The minimum distance between any two marked numbers in a circular arrangement of \( M-1 \) integers can be calculated by considering the maximum possible difference between consecutive intervals.

3. **Determine Maximum Possible Minimum Distance**: Since each interval contains all integers from its start to its end, the maximum possible minimum distance is simply the length of the largest interval, which is \( R_{N} - L_{N} + 1 \).

The key observation here is that each interval contains all the integers between its endpoints, so the distances between consecutive intervals are simply the lengths of these intervals.

Given the constraints and the problem's requirements, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the Lengths of Intervals**: For each interval, the length \( L_i \) is given by \( R_i - L_i + 1 \). This is because the interval contains all integers from \( L_i \) to \( R_i \).

2. **Calculate Minimum Distance Between Marked Numbers**: The minimum distance between any two marked numbers in a circular arrangement of \( M-1 \) integers can be calculated by considering the maximum possible difference between consecutive intervals.

3. **Determine Maximum Possible Minimum Distance**: Since each interval contains all integers from its start to its end, the maximum possible minimum distance is simply the length of the largest interval, which is \( R_{N} - L_{N} + 1 \).

Here's how you can implement this:

1. Define a function `validate_email` that takes two parameters: `email` (the email address) and `domain_list` (a list of company domains).
2. Use the `isinstance` method to check if the provided `email` is indeed a string.
3. Validate the email format using a regular expression pattern.
4. Check if the domain matches any in the provided list.
5. Return appropriate error messages or return `True` if all checks pass.

Let's start by implementing this function:

```python
import re

Write corresponding code in Python.,118,29,short,,"The `break` keyword in a loop structure in Python is used to exit the current iteration of the loop immediately, without executing any subsequent statements or lines of code within that loop.

Here's an example of how you can use the `break` keyword in a loop:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

In this example, the loop will iterate through numbers from 0 to 9. If it encounters the number 5, which is one of the loop's conditions (i.e., `if i == 5:`), the `break` keyword will immediately exit the loop and move on to the next iteration.

If you run this code, you'll see that the output will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9

1. **Count the occurrences of each element**: Iterate through the array and count how many times each element appears.
2. **Sum the counts**: Add up all the counts to get the total number of times the specific value exists in the array.

Let's break this down with a more detailed explanation:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `count`: A list to keep track of how many times each element appears.
   - `n`: The size of the array, which is up to \( 10^9 \).

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element in the array, increment its count in the `count` list.

3. **Sum the Counts**:
   - After iterating through all elements, sum the counts in the `count` list to get the total number of times the specific value exists in the array.

Edit: I was looking for a general caching schema for internal and external applications",158,39,short,,"Implementing distributed caching in .NET involves several key steps:

1. **Choose a Caching Solution**: There are various options available such as Redis, Memcached, Apache Cassandra, or even custom solutions like Redis with RabbitMQ.

2. **Set Up the Cache**: This typically involves configuring the cache to store data and retrieve it from the database or another source when needed.

3. **Implement Data Access Patterns**: Decide how you want to access your data within the application. For example:
   - **Local Storage**: Use local storage (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) for simple, in-memory caching.
   - **Database**: Store data in a database and use it directly when needed.
   - **API Gateway**: Use an API gateway to handle requests from multiple applications and cache responses.

4. **Use Caching Libraries**: There are several .NET libraries that can help with caching:
   - **Redis**: Provides a simple, lightweight, and highly performant in-memory data store.
   - **Memcached**: A distributed memory caching system that supports both local and remote storage.
   - **Cassandra**: A distributed key-value database that is known for its high performance and scalability.

Edit: I was looking for a general caching schema for internal and external applications",158,39,short,,"Implementing distributed caching in .NET involves several key considerations:

1. **Understanding Distributed Caching**: Before diving into implementation, it's important to understand what distributed caching is and how it works. Distributed caching systems like Redis, Memcached, or Azure Cache are designed to store data across multiple servers, making them ideal for applications that need to cache frequently accessed data.

2. **Choosing a Distro Cache**: There are several popular distributed caching solutions available in .NET:
   - **Redis**: A key-value database optimized for high performance and scalability.
   - **Memcached**: A simple, lightweight, and fast caching solution.
   - **Azure Cache**: A managed service that provides a scalable, fault-tolerant cache across multiple servers.

3. **Configuration**: You need to configure the distributed caching system in your .NET application. This typically involves setting up the connection string or URL for the distributed cache, specifying the data type (e.g., key-value), and defining how the data is stored.

4. **Implementing the Cache**: Once the configuration is set up, you can implement the cache logic within your application. This might involve using a simple dictionary to store cached data, or more complex mechanisms like Redis' in-memory caching or Memcached's in-memory mode",3.7248988151550293,0.10015510000000001,0.005079231764705883,3.724385976791382,2.01113083783318e-06,0.005059391015625,197.65224646833653,256,0.013810600000000001,1.2952041,1.6841806000000001,0.0863445,57,0.013810600000000001,256,1.2952041

- **Loop**: The loop continues as long as `num` is greater than 0. In each iteration, we extract the last digit of `num` using `num % 10`, convert it back to an integer (`digit`), and add it to `total`.
  
- **Update `num`**: After adding the current digit, we divide `num` by 10 to remove the last digit.

### Output:
The code will output:

Explanation:
- We initialize `total` to 0.
- We use a while loop that continues as long as the number is greater than 0.
- Inside the loop, we get the last digit of the current number by taking the modulus (`%`) with 10. This gives us the rightmost digit.
- We add this digit to `total`.
- We update the original number by dividing it by 10 using integer division (`//`), effectively removing the rightmost digit.

Explanation:
- We initialize `total` to 0.
- We use a while loop that continues as long as the number is greater than 0.
- Inside the loop, we get the last digit of the current number by taking the modulus (`%`) with 10. This gives us the rightmost digit.
- We add this digit to `total`.
- We update the original number by dividing it by 10 using integer division (`//`), effectively removing the rightmost digit.
- Finally, we print the value of `total`, which contains the sum of all digits in the given number.",3.3222177028656006,0.0999531,0.0050072390625,3.3222177028656006,0.0,0.00498129481865285,200.75101683510508,193,0.0118492,0.9613899,1.2623324,0.0881039,76,0.0118492,193,0.9613899

For example, consider the problem of finding the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. The lexicographically smallest path is the one that, when represented as a sequence of vertices, would come first in a lexicographical ordering.

Write a function `findLexicographicallySmallestEulerianPath(graph, start)` that takes in the following parameters:
- `graph`: a dictionary representing the directed graph, where the keys are vertices and the values are lists of vertices to which there is a directed edge from the key vertex.
- `start`: the starting vertex for the path.

The function should return a list representing the lexicographically smallest Eulerian path starting from the given vertex. If multiple Eulerian paths exist, return any one of them.

   - Update the value at the `prev` pointer's previous node with the value at the `curr` pointer's current node.
   - Move the `prev` pointer to the `curr` pointer.

3. After traversing the entire list, the `prev` pointer will point to the head of the reversed list.

```javascript
function reverseStringWithoutBuiltIn(str) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = str.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        // Swap characters at positions left and right
        [str[left], str[right]] = [str[right], str[left]];
        
        // Move both pointers towards each other
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    return str;
}

The expression should also have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

Additionally, ensure that your solution handles cases where the input string contains special characters, whitespace, and uppercase letters. The reversed string should maintain the same capitalization and spacing as the original string.

You should also provide a detailed explanation of the steps involved in your solution, including any auxiliary data structures or algorithms used.",660,165,long,,"To reverse a string without using built-in methods like `reverse()`, we can use two pointers approach with additional logic to handle special characters, whitespace, and uppercase letters. Here's how you can do it:

1. Initialize two pointers: one at the start (`left`) and another at the end of the string (`right`).
2. While the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer:
   - Swap the values at these two positions.
   - Move both pointers towards each other until they meet or cross.
3. After the loop, swap the values at the `left` and `right` pointers.

Here's a JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function reverseStringWithoutBuiltIn(str) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = str.length - 1;

  - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
  
- **`if s[i] != s[j]:`**:

qwen2.5:0.5b,77,4,2026-01-21T15:01:39.621881,"You are given the definition of a Node class used in a tree structure. Each node in the tree has a value and a list of its children. The code snippet provided below is a Python function that takes the root node of a tree as input and returns a list of values obtained by performing a post-order traversal of the tree.

The Node class is defined as follows:
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, children):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children
```

Your task is to implement a function that constructs the tree from the given list of values and children, and then performs a post-order traversal to return the list of values in reverse order.

Write a function `post_order_reverse(root: Node) -> List[int]` to accomplish this task.

For example, given the following tree:
```
      1
     /|\
    3 2 4
   / \
  5   6
```
The post-order traversal of the tree would be [5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1].

Your task is to implement the `post_order_reverse` function to achieve the same result.",1006,251,very_long,,"```python
from typing import List

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int, children: List[int]):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children

def post_order_reverse(root: Node) -> List[int]:
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    stack = [root]
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        result.append(node.val)
        
        for child in node.children[::-1]:  # Reverse the list of children
            stack.append(child)
    
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    root = Node(1, [Node(3, [Node(5), Node(6)]), Node(2, [])])
    print(post_order_reverse(root))  # Output: [5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1]
```

In this solution, the `post_order_reverse` function uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal of the tree.

1. **Define the Sieve of Eratosthenes**: This is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.

1. **Subject Categories**: This is a fundamental concept in information retrieval systems. It helps to categorize the various types of content (e.g., research papers, books, patents) into specific categories.

2. **Document Types**: Each document type can be further divided into subtypes such as ""Research Papers,"" ""Books,"" ""Patents,"" etc. This allows for a more detailed and precise classification of each type of content.

3. **Authorship Information**: Each author should have their own unique identifier, which could be a combination of their name, affiliation, or other relevant information.

4. **Publication Dates**: The publication dates of the documents can be stored in a way that allows for easy retrieval by date range.

5. **Citation and References**: A citation system is essential to link each document with its corresponding author, title, and publication date. This helps in identifying the source of each piece of information.

6. **Metadata**: Metadata provides additional context about the documents, such as their authors, institutions, or keywords that describe the content.

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize `n` to store the length of the list, which represents the number of points.

2. We iterate through each point in the list and calculate the squared distance between it and every other point using the formula `(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2`.

3. For each pair of points, we calculate the squared distance between them.

The key point here is that it requires all executable memory areas to be unmapped.
To achieve this without unmapping the area where the program itself is running, you can use the `prctl` system call instead of `PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE`. The `prctl` system call allows you to set a process's control parameters, including setting the file descriptor for the executable memory areas.
Here's an example of how you could use `prctl` to achieve this:
```bash
prctl -n ""set_executable"" 0x1234567890abcdef
```

In this command, `-n` is used to set a process's control parameter. The value `""set_executable""` specifies that the file should be executable.
Note that `prctl` requires root privileges to work properly. If you don't have root privileges, you'll need to use `sudo`.
Also, keep in mind that using `prctl` can potentially cause issues if not used carefully, as it modifies the process's control parameters and may affect other system services or processes.

This algorithm will utilize various NLP techniques and machine learning models to classify input statements into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library for tokenization and stemming
- spaCy library for entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging
- scikit-learn library for machine learning model training and evaluation

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenize the input text, remove stop words, and perform stemming or lemmatization to normalize the words.
2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Use spaCy to identify the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each word in the preprocessed text.
3. **Entity Recognition**: Utilize spaCy's entity recognition capabilities to identify named entities (people, places, organizations) and their corresponding sentiment labels.
4. **Sentiment Lexicon Integration**: Integrate a sentiment lexicon (e.g., VADER, TextBlob",5.403184175491333,0.14369510000000002,0.011538799215686275,5.402676582336426,1.9905613917930455e-06,0.01149372578125,87.00398974467659,256,0.035253,2.9423938,3.3503811000000003,0.10844210000000001,145,0.035253,256,2.9423938

Here are some best practices to help you optimize your application's memory usage and GC performance:

1.  **Monitor Memory Usage**: Use tools like VisualVM, JConsole, or Java Mission Control to monitor your application's memory usage in real-time. This will help you identify memory leaks, high memory usage patterns, and other issues that can impact GC performance.

2.  **Use the Right Heap Size**: The heap size determines how much memory is available for object allocation. A larger heap size can improve GC performance but may also increase pause times. Use the `Xmx` and `Xms` options to set the maximum and initial heap sizes, respectively.

3.  **Adjust the Young Generation Size**: The young generation ( Eden space) is where most objects are allocated. Adjusting its size can impact GC performance. A larger young generation can reduce pause times but may increase memory usage.

4.  **Use G1 Garbage Collector**: The G1 garbage collector is designed to provide low-pause-time garbage collection and is suitable for cloud-based applications.

The generator should repeat each value in the `BASE_PATTERN` `i + 1` times, skipping the first occurrence of each value.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the `pattern_generator` function to achieve the desired pattern generation behavior.

The `pattern_generator` function should have the following signature:
```python
def pattern_generator(i):
    # Your implementation here
```

Example:
If `BASE_PATTERN = [1, 2, 3]` and `i = 2`, the expected output from the generator would be `[2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1]`.",785,196,long,,"def pattern_generator(i):

Description are as below: There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in this code:

1. Initially, `i` is set to 4.
2. The while loop condition checks if `i` is less than or equal to 16. Since `i` is 4, the loop executes.
3. Inside the loop, it prints the cube of the current value of `i`, which is `4 ** 3 = 64`.
4. Then, it increments `i` by 4, making it 8.
5. Steps 2-4 repeat until `i` surpasses 16.

The resultant output will be:

```
64
128
192
256
```

However, since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than or equal to 16, and after the first iteration `i` becomes 8 (which is greater than 4), the loop should terminate.

1. Initially, `i` is set to 4.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure. It's called ""self-balancing"" because it automatically rebalances itself whenever the balance factor of any node becomes too large.

**What is Balance Factor?**

The balance factor of a node in an AVL tree is calculated as follows:

Balance Factor = Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree

If the balance factor is greater than 1, the left subtree is too tall and needs to be balanced. If it's less than -1, the right subtree is too tall.

**How Does AVL Tree Balance?**

To balance an AVL tree, we need to perform rotations on nodes when the balance factor becomes too large. There are four types of rotations:

1. **Left Rotation**: When the left child of a node is too tall, we rotate it to the right.
2. **Right Rotation**: When the right child of a node is too tall, we rotate it to the left.
3. **Left-Right Rotation**: When both children are too tall, we perform a combination of rotations to balance the tree.
4. **Right-Left Rotation**: Similar to the above, but with the opposite rotation.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure. It's called ""self-balancing"" because it automatically rebalances itself whenever the height of the left or right subtree exceeds a certain threshold.

Here are the key concepts and algorithms involved in balancing an AVL tree:

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Height**: The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.
2. **Balance Factor**: The balance factor of a node is the difference between its height and the height of its children (left and right). A positive balance factor indicates that the left subtree is taller, while a negative balance factor indicates that the right subtree is taller.
3. **Left-Right Balance**: An AVL tree is balanced if the absolute value of the balance factor of every node is less than or equal to 1.

**Balancing Algorithm:**

The balancing algorithm works as follows:

1. When a new node is inserted into the tree, calculate its balance factor.
2. If the balance factor is greater than 1 (i.e., the left subtree is too tall), perform one of two operations:

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure. It's called ""self-balancing"" because it automatically rebalances itself whenever the height of the left or right subtree exceeds a certain threshold.

Here are the key concepts and algorithms involved in balancing an AVL tree:

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Height**: The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.
2. **Balance Factor**: The balance factor of a node is the difference between its height and the height of its children (left and right). A positive balance factor indicates that the left subtree is taller, while a negative balance factor indicates that the right subtree is taller.
3. **Left-Right Balance**: An AVL tree is balanced if the absolute value of the balance factor of every node is less than or equal to 1.

**Balancing Algorithm:**

The balancing algorithm works as follows:

1. When a new node is inserted into the tree, calculate its balance factor.
2. If the balance factor is greater than 1 (i.e., the left subtree is too tall), perform one of two operations:

The function should check if the dictionary adheres to the specified rules and return a boolean value indicating whether the validation was successful or not.

The validation rules are defined as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a validation rule. Each rule dictionary contains the following keys:
- 'name': The name of the field to be validated.
- 'description': A description of the field.
- 'in': The location of the field in the input data (e.g., 'formData', 'json', 'query').

The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing a simple if-else statement. It consists of three parts: the condition, the value if true, and the value if false.

In recursive methods, the ternary operator can be used to simplify the logic and make the code more readable. Here's an example in Python:

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

However, we can simplify the recursive method using a ternary operator:

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * (factorial(n-1) if n > 1 else 1)

The organisms should display behaviors such as darting, rotating, and modulating their depth in a probabilistic manner, and then proceed to swim. The animation should mirror reality, taking into account factors like aquatic currents, gravitational pull, marine biodiversity, and obstructions in the habitat such as corals and aquatic plants.

The marine organisms should transition their pigmentation from cerulean to emerald and then to violet as they swim, simulating the effect of sunlight penetrating through the water surface. The color transition should be gradual and lifelike. The reflections of the organisms should also modify in accordance with the position of a simulated moving light source.

Incorporate a current effect that influences the swimming trajectory of the organisms. The current should be represented as a variable force, causing the organisms to sway left and right, and up and down as they swim. The strength, direction, and depth of the current should fluctuate over time, and this should be reflected in the organisms' movement.

The SVG markup should be optimized for performance and should function across all contemporary web browsers. Provide a piece of erroneous code that attempts to create the SVG markup and animation. Identify and rectify the errors in the code, and elucidate why the original code was incorrect.

The organisms should also turn and modulate their depth as they swim, with the turn speed, direction, and depth change being random over time to simulate the effect of water turbulence. The turn and depth change should also affect the position and intensity of the reflection.

The SVG markup should also include a background scene of a detailed coral reef ecosystem, including a variety of corals, aquatic plants, and a shining sun, and the organisms should swim across this environment. The environment should also be affected by the changing light source and current, with their reflections and shapes altering accordingly.

The organisms should vanish when they reach a certain distance, with the tail disappearing last. The disappearing should be realistic, with the inside of the coral and aquatic plants revealed. The organisms should also persist in changing color and casting reflections in accordance with the light source.

The second, third, fourth, and fifth organisms should swim a few seconds after the first one, each following a different path and affected by different current conditions. The organisms should interact with each other and the environment if they come into contact while swimming or after disappearing.

The SVG markup and animation should be created using only JavaScript and SVG, without any external libraries or tools. The code should be well-commented and easy to comprehend, and should adhere to best practices for performance and readability.

In addition, the code should also include a user interface that allows users to control the speed, direction, and color of the organisms, as well as the intensity and direction of the current. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, and should also be created using only JavaScript and SVG.

Furthermore, the user interface should allow users to add or remove organisms mid-animation, and the code should dynamically adjust the animation and interactions accordingly. The organisms should also emit a trail as they swim, with the trail's color and intensity changing in accordance with the organisms' color and speed.

Moreover, the user interface should allow users to control the time of day, altering the lighting conditions and color palette of the scene. The organisms should also respond to user input, altering their swimming patterns and behaviors in real-time. The user interface should also allow users to add or remove obstacles in the environment, and the organisms should dynamically adjust their swimming patterns to evade these obstacles.

llama3.2:latest,28,4,2026-01-21T15:20:55.234119,"Could you construct an SVG markup that portrays a complex marine ecosystem, integrating a three-dimensional illusion, and a phosphorescent reflection effect for the aquatic organisms? The organisms should display behaviors such as darting, rotating, and modulating their depth in a probabilistic manner, and then proceed to swim. The animation should mirror reality, taking into account factors like aquatic currents, gravitational pull, marine biodiversity, and obstructions in the habitat such as corals and aquatic plants.

The marine organisms should transition their pigmentation from cerulean to emerald and then to violet as they swim, simulating the effect of sunlight penetrating through the water surface. The color transition should be gradual and lifelike. The reflections of the organisms should also modify in accordance with the position of a simulated moving light source.

Incorporate a current effect that influences the swimming trajectory of the organisms. The current should be represented as a variable force, causing the organisms to sway left and right, and up and down as they swim. The strength, direction, and depth of the current should fluctuate over time, and this should be reflected in the organisms' movement.

The SVG markup should be optimized for performance and should function across all contemporary web browsers. Provide a piece of erroneous code that attempts to create the SVG markup and animation. Identify and rectify the errors in the code, and elucidate why the original code was incorrect.

The organisms should also turn and modulate their depth as they swim, with the turn speed, direction, and depth change being random over time to simulate the effect of water turbulence. The turn and depth change should also affect the position and intensity of the reflection.

The SVG markup should also include a background scene of a detailed coral reef ecosystem, including a variety of corals, aquatic plants, and a shining sun, and the organisms should swim across this environment. The environment should also be affected by the changing light source and current, with their reflections and shapes altering accordingly.

The organisms should vanish when they reach a certain distance, with the tail disappearing last. The disappearing should be realistic, with the inside of the coral and aquatic plants revealed. The organisms should also persist in changing color and casting reflections in accordance with the light source.

The second, third, fourth, and fifth organisms should swim a few seconds after the first one, each following a different path and affected by different current conditions. The organisms should interact with each other and the environment if they come into contact while swimming or after disappearing.

The SVG markup and animation should be created using only JavaScript and SVG, without any external libraries or tools. The code should be well-commented and easy to comprehend, and should adhere to best practices for performance and readability.

In addition, the code should also include a user interface that allows users to control the speed, direction, and color of the organisms, as well as the intensity and direction of the current. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, and should also be created using only JavaScript and SVG.

Furthermore, the user interface should allow users to add or remove organisms mid-animation, and the code should dynamically adjust the animation and interactions accordingly. The organisms should also emit a trail as they swim, with the trail's color and intensity changing in accordance with the organisms' color and speed.

Moreover, the user interface should allow users to control the time of day, altering the lighting conditions and color palette of the scene. The organisms should also respond to user input, altering their swimming patterns and behaviors in real-time. The user interface should also allow users to add or remove obstacles in the environment, and the organisms should dynamically adjust their swimming patterns to evade these obstacles.

Additionally, the SVG markup should include a predator shark that follows the school of organisms, with its speed and direction influenced by the movement of the school. The predator shark should also react to the user's input, altering its hunting patterns and behaviors in real-time.

To increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the food chain, with smaller organisms being eaten by larger organisms. The organisms should exhibit realistic behaviors when hunting or being hunted, such as fear, aggression, and evasion. The code should also simulate the life cycle of the organisms, with organisms growing larger over time, reproducing, and eventually dying. The user interface should allow users to control the population size, growth rate, and lifespan of the organisms. The code should also include a simulation of the ecosystem, with the health of the environment affecting the health and behavior of the organisms.

To further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of underwater sounds on the behavior of the organisms. The code should simulate the effects of sounds produced by other marine animals, human activities, and natural phenomena on the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as fear, curiosity, and aggression in response to these sounds. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the sounds, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in sound. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of light on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as attraction, repulsion, and confusion in response to different colors and intensities of light. The user interface should allow users to control the color and intensity of the light, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in light.

**Mutable Objects**

A mutable object is an object that can be modified after it's created. Its properties or state can be changed, and its internal structure can be altered. Mutable objects are typically used when you need to modify the data in some way, such as when working with collections, arrays, or other data structures.

Characteristics of mutable objects:

1. **Modifiable**: The object's properties or state can be changed.
2. **Alterable**: The internal structure of the object can be modified.
3. **Stateful**: The object maintains its own state, which can change over time.

Examples of mutable objects include:

* Arrays
* Linked lists
* Dictionaries (in some programming languages)
* Objects with mutable attributes

**Immutable Objects**

An immutable object is an object that cannot be modified after it's created. Its properties or state are fixed and cannot be changed. Immutable objects are typically used when you need to ensure data integrity, prevent unintended changes, or create a snapshot of data.

The sonnet should also use iambic pentameter and include an example of dramatic irony.,198,49,short,,"When twilight's hush doth softly fall on earth,
And memories, like whispers, start to creep
Into my mind, where shadows give their birth,
I find myself lost in a bygone sleep.

The ghosts of love and laughter, long since past,
Do haunt me still, with whispers that would say
""Arise, dear heart, and let the present last,""
But I, in sorrow, cannot break away

From dreams of what could never be regained,
And though I know 'tis futile to pursue
The fleeting joys of youth's brief reign,
I'll chase the shadows, till my heart is blue.

Yet still, I'll hold on to these memories dear,

One way to do this is by using a brute force approach, where we iterate through all possible values of n and check if n - 1 is divisible by B(n).",5.470368146896362,0.14763810000000002,0.011812278823529414,5.4698591232299805,1.9961712407130822e-06,0.011766137109375002,84.98966064259287,256,0.037698100000000005,3.0121311000000004,3.4079543,0.10994000000000001,340,0.037698100000000005,256,3.0121311000000004

You are supposed to mark exactly $N$ numbers: $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$, such that $L_{i} ≤ A_{i} ≤ R_{i}$ for all $1 ≤ i ≤ N$. And you want to do it in such a manner $min_{i \neq j}$ (shortest distance between $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ ), is maximized.

------ Input: ------

First line of the input contains a pair of integers $M$ and $N$.
The i-th of the next $N$ lines contains two numbers $L_{i}$ and $R_{i}$ which denote the end points of the i-th interval.

------ Output: ------
A single integer denoting the maximized minimum distance between any two marked numbers.

------ Constraints  ------
$1 ≤ M ≤ 10^{18}$
$2 ≤ N ≤ 4 * 10^{5}$

------ Subtasks ------
10 points : 
	- $1 ≤ M ≤ 10000$
	- $2 ≤ N ≤ 100$
25 points : 
	- $1 ≤ M ≤ 10^{18}$
	- $2 ≤ N ≤ 1000$
65 points : No further constraints.

----- explanation 1 ------ 
We can choose $A_{1} = 0, A_{2} = 3, A_{3} = 6$. The distance between every adjacent marked pair of numbers is 3, and hence that is the minimum. You can check that you cannot do any better, and hence 3 is the answer.",1887,471,very_long,,"import sys

The projectile is launched from the origin (0, 0) with an initial velocity v0 at an angle θ to the horizontal axis. The simulation should consider the effects of air resistance, which is proportional to the square of the projectile's velocity and acts in the opposite direction of its motion. The equation of motion for the projectile, accounting for air resistance, is given by:

\[ m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -k v \frac{dx}{dt} \]

**Overview**

The proposed plan utilizes a combination of hash table and doubly linked list data structures to create an efficient and scalable implementation. The hash table will serve as the underlying data structure, while the doubly linked list will be used to manage the elements stored in the hash table.

**Hash Table Implementation**

1.  **Initialization**: Create a new instance of the hash table with a suitable size (e.g., 1024) and an empty array to store the linked lists.
2.  **Insertion**: When inserting a new element into the doubly linked list, first check if the element already exists in the hash table. If it does, update its position in the linked list. Otherwise, create a new entry in the hash table and add the element to the end of the corresponding linked list.
3.  **Deletion**: When deleting an element from the doubly linked list, first check if the element exists in the hash table. If it does, remove it from its current position in the linked list and update the hash table entry accordingly.

**Doubly Linked List Implementation**

1.  **Node Structure**: Define a node structure with two pointers: `prev` and `next`, which",5.407362699508667,0.1396253,0.011612979607843138,5.407362699508667,0.0,0.01156761640625,86.44823314332056,256,0.0360158,2.9613098,3.3528915,0.10360950000000001,158,0.0360158,256,2.9613098

Write corresponding code in Python.,118,29,short,,"The `break` keyword in Python is used to exit a loop prematurely. It is used when you want to stop the execution of a loop before its normal termination condition is met.

Here's an example of using the `break` keyword in a for loop:

```python

for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == 'banana':
        print(fruit)
        break  # Exit the loop when 'banana' is found

In this example, the `break` keyword will exit the loop as soon as it encounters the string `'banana'`. The rest of the elements in the list are not printed.

```python
# Example of using break in a while loop

    print(i)
    if i == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when i reaches 5

=====================================

Distributed caching is an essential component of modern web applications, allowing you to store frequently accessed data across multiple servers. Here's a general approach to implementing distributed caching with .NET:

**Architecture Overview**

1.  **Cache Store**: Choose a cache store that can handle high traffic and provides low latency. Some popular options include:
    *   Redis
    *   Memcached
    *   Azure Cache for Redis
    *   Amazon ElastiCache
2.  **Cache Client Library**: Use a cache client library to interact with the cache store from your .NET application. Some popular options include:
    *   StackExchange.Redis (for Redis)
    *   Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory (for in-memory caching)
3.  **Distributed Cache Cluster**: Set up a distributed cache cluster using multiple instances of the cache store and client library.

**Implementation Steps**

### Step 1: Choose a Cache Store

Select a cache store that meets your application's requirements. Consider factors such as:

*   Scalability
*   Performance
*   Data consistency
*   Security

For example, Redis is a popular choice for distributed caching due to its high performance and scalability.

    *   Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory (for in-memory caching)
3.  **Distributed Cache Cluster**: Set up a distributed cache cluster using multiple instances of the cache store and client library.

**Implementation Steps**

### Step 1: Choose a Cache Store

Select a cache store that meets your application's requirements. Consider factors such as:

*   Performance
*   Scalability
*   Data consistency
*   Security

For example, Redis is a popular choice for distributed caching due to its high performance and scalability.

Edit: I was looking for a general caching schema for internal and external applications",158,39,short,,"Implementing Distributed Caching in .NET
=====================================

Distributed caching is an essential component of modern web applications, allowing you to store frequently accessed data across multiple servers. Here's a general approach to implementing distributed caching with .NET:

**Architecture Overview**

1.  **Cache Store**: Choose a cache store that can handle high traffic and provides low latency. Some popular options include:
    *   Redis
    *   Memcached
    *   Azure Cache for Redis
    *   Amazon ElastiCache
2.  **Cache Client Library**: Use a cache client library to interact with the cache store from your .NET application. Some popular options include:
    *   StackExchange.Redis (for Redis)
    *   Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory (for in-memory caching)
3.  **Distributed Cache Cluster**: Set up a distributed cache cluster using multiple instances of the cache store and client library.

The vending machine will have a set of available items with corresponding prices. The user will input money and select an item to purchase. The function should handle the transaction, calculate change (if any), and return the selected item along with any change due.

The function signature should be:
```python
def vending_machine(items, item, money):

Where:
- `items` (dict): A dictionary containing the available items as keys and their prices as values, e.g., `{'cola': 1.50, 'chips': 1.00, 'candy': 0.75}`.
- `item` (str): The item selected by the user.
- `money` (float): The amount of money inserted by the user.

1. We initialize `num` with the input number and `total` to store the sum of its digits.
2. The while loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
3. Inside the loop, we extract the last digit from `num` using the modulo operator (`%`). This gives us the remainder when `num` is divided by 10, which represents the last digit.
4. We add this extracted digit to `total`.
5. To remove the last digit from `num`, we use integer division (`//=`) instead of regular division (`/=`).

        return arr[n // 2]
    
    # If the length is even, return the average of the two middle numbers
    else:
        mid1 = arr[(n - 1) // 2]
        mid2 = arr[n // 2]
        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2

# Test the function with your array
arr = [3, 2, 4, 1, 5]
print(""Median:"", calculate_median(arr))
```

This code sorts the input array in ascending order and then checks if its length is odd or even. If it's odd, it returns the middle number; otherwise, it returns the average of the two middle numbers.

Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in `statistics` module to calculate the median:

```python
import statistics

def calculate_median(arr):
    return statistics.median",5.301724433898926,0.1428801,0.011220152156862746,5.301724433898926,0.0,0.0111763234375,89.47486224715837,256,0.0362264,2.8611388,3.2385714,0.1066537,65,0.0362264,256,2.8611388

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this solution works:

1.  Initialize an empty string `reversedStr` to store the reversed input string.
2.  Iterate over the characters in the input string from right to left using a for loop that starts at the last index (`str.length - 1`) and decrements until it reaches the first character (index 0).
3.  Inside the loop, check",5.80290961265564,0.7128846000000001,0.010827029019607845,5.8024046421051025,1.980276668772978e-06,0.010784735937500001,92.72364254398323,256,0.605836,2.7608924000000004,3.7298202000000003,0.10704860000000001,142,0.605836,256,2.7608924000000004

Explanation of changes:

*   We use list comprehension to filter out non-alphanumeric characters from the input string and convert it to lowercase. This ensures that spaces, punctuation marks, and capitalization do not affect the palindrome check.
*   Instead of using two pointers (i and j) to compare characters from both ends of the string, we directly compare the cleaned string with its reverse (`cleaned_s[::-",5.414546966552734,0.1424839,0.011668153725490198,5.414038181304932,1.995236265893076e-06,0.011622575000000001,86.0394533913526,256,0.0361913,2.9753792000000003,3.3626571000000003,0.1062926,177,0.0361913,256,2.9753792000000003

llama3.2:latest,82,4,2026-01-21T15:44:41.192923,"You are tasked with implementing a cookie management system in TypeScript. The `Cookie` type is defined in a separate file and needs to be imported for use in the main codebase. The `Cookie` type has the following structure:
```typescript
interface Cookie {
  name: string;
  value: string;
  expirationDate: Date;
}
```
Your task is to create a class called `CookieManager` that provides methods for managing cookies. The class should have the following methods:
1. `setCookie(name: string, value: string, expirationDate: Date): void` - This method should create a new `Cookie` object with the provided name, value, and expiration date, and store it in the cookie manager.
2. `getCookie(name: string): Cookie | undefined` - This method should return the `Cookie` object with the specified name if it exists in the cookie manager, or `undefined` if it does not.
3. `deleteCookie(name: string): void` - This method should remove the `Cookie` object with the specified name from the cookie manager.

You should import the `Cookie` type from the `../types` module and use it within the `CookieManager` class to manage the cookies.

Implement the `CookieManager` class with the specified methods and ensure that the `Cookie` type is correctly imported and used.",1257,314,very_long,,"```typescript

I think I might be misunderstanding the man page. I tried reading through /proc/self/maps and munmapping all executable regions, but this unsurprisingly segfaulted. Is the man page referring to something else, or am I supposed to be using some other magic to get this to work?",491,122,medium,,"The `PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE` command is used to set the executable file for a process, and it requires all executable memory areas to be unmapped before it can take effect. However, you're correct that trying to unmmap the area where your program itself is running will result in a segmentation fault.

The issue here is that `PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE` doesn't actually change the executable file of the process; instead, it sets the memory mapping for the process's address space to match the contents of the specified file. This means that you need to ensure all executable regions are unmapped before calling this command.

To achieve this without segfaulting, you can use the `mmap` system call with the `MAP_ANONYMOUS` flag to create a new anonymous mapping for your program's executable region. Here's an example of how you might do this:

```c
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    // Create a new anonymous mapping for the executable region

SELECT product.name, store.location, store.country
FROM product
INNER JOIN store
ON product.store_id = store.store_id",181,45,short,,"Here's how you can convert the given SQL query to a Python pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data for demonstration purposes
product_data = {
    'name': ['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C'],
    'store_id': [1, 2, 3]
}

store_data = {
    'location': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago'],
    'country': ['USA', 'USA', 'USA']
}

# Create DataFrames
product_df = pd.DataFrame(product_data)
store_df = pd.DataFrame(store_data)

# Perform inner join on product and store dataframes
joined_df = pd.merge(product_df, store_df, on='store_id')

print(joined_df)
```

In this example, we create two sample DataFrames `product_df` and `store_df`. We then use the `pd.merge()` function to perform an inner join between these two DataFrames based on the 'store_id' column. The resulting DataFrame will contain the product names, store locations, and countries.

The output of this code will be:

```

2.  Then we create two sample DataFrames (`product_df` and `store_df`) to mimic the structure of the SQL query's tables.

For your reference, here is a flawed code that is unable to accurately identify nested palindromes and non-alphanumeric characters:

```python
def find_palindromes(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = text.replace(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;)
    palindromes = []
    for i in range(len(text)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(text)):
            if text[i:j] == text[i:j][::-1]:
                palindromes.append(text[i:j])
    return palindromes
```

This code is unsuccessful in accurately identifying nested palindromes and non-alphanumeric characters. Your mission is to rectify these issues and augment the functionality of the subroutine as outlined above. You should also ensure that the subroutine meets the specified time and space complexity requirements.",1989,497,very_long,,"def find_palindromes(text):

mistral:7b,3,0,2026-01-21T15:54:30.830440,"You are working on a particle physics analysis project and need to write a custom filter for selecting events based on certain criteria. In this scenario, you are using the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) software framework, and you need to define a specific cut for event selection.

The provided code snippet is a part of the configuration for defining a cut on a specific input tag in the CMS framework. The `src` variable represents the input tag for the event, and the `cut` variable contains the string defining the cut criteria. The `isHypoValid` function is used to check the validity of a hypothesis, and `genMatchSumDR` is a variable representing the sum of delta R values for gen-matched particles.

Your task is to implement the logic for the `isHypoValid` function and define the cut criteria based on the given context.

Write a function in Python that takes the `isHypoValid` condition and the `genMatchSumDR` value as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the event passes the cut criteria.",1011,252,very_long,," In the CMS framework, the `isHypoValid` function is typically used to check if a certain hypothesis (a combination of conditions) is valid for an event. For this example, let's assume that we want to select events where the sum of delta R values for gen-matched particles is less than 1.0.

Here's how you can implement the `isHypoValid` function in Python:

```python
def isHypoValid(genMatchSumDR, cutValue=1.0):
    """"""
    Check if the event passes the given cut criteria based on genMatchSumDR.

    Parameters:
        genMatchSumDR (float): The sum of delta R values for gen-matched particles.
        cutValue (float, optional): The threshold value for the cut. Defaults to 1.0.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the event passes the cut criteria, False otherwise.
    """"""
    return genMatchSumDR < cutValue

1. **Choosing the Right Garbage Collector (GC):** Different GC algorithms are designed to cater to various application requirements. For cloud-based applications, G1 Garbage Collector is often recommended due to its ability to handle large heaps and pause times effectively. Other options include Shenandoah, Zing, or customizing the default HotSpot GC based on your specific use case.

2. **Heap Size Configuration:** Properly configure the heap size for your application. A larger heap may lead to better performance for memory-intensive applications but can also increase garbage collection pauses. Conversely, a smaller heap might result in more frequent collections and potential performance issues. You can use JMX or command-line tools like VisualVM to monitor heap usage and adjust the heap size accordingly.

mistral:7b,12,4,2026-01-21T16:00:45.270045,"You are tasked with implementing a pattern generator function that takes an integer `i` as input and yields a specific pattern based on a predefined `BASE_PATTERN`. The `BASE_PATTERN` is a sequence of values that the generator will iterate through. The generator should repeat each value in the `BASE_PATTERN` `i + 1` times, skipping the first occurrence of each value.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the `pattern_generator` function to achieve the desired pattern generation behavior.

The `pattern_generator` function should have the following signature:
```python
def pattern_generator(i):
    # Your implementation here
```

Example:
If `BASE_PATTERN = [1, 2, 3]` and `i = 2`, the expected output from the generator would be `[2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1]`.",785,196,long,," To achieve this, we can create a generator function that uses the `itertools.cycle` and `itertools.islice` functions from Python's built-in `itertools` module to repeat each value in the `BASE_PATTERN` the required number of times while skipping the first occurrence of each value.

Here is the implementation of the `pattern_generator` function:

```python
import itertools

def pattern_generator(i, base_pattern=None):
    if not base_pattern:
        base_pattern = []

    repeated_pattern = itertools.chain(*(itertools.islice(itertools.cycle(sub_pattern), i) for sub_pattern in base_pattern))
    next(repeated_pattern)  # Skip the first occurrence of each value

    return repeated_pattern
```

Now, if you call `pattern_generator(2, [1, 2, 3])`, it will generate the expected output:

```python
pattern = list(pattern_generator(2, [1, 2, 3]))
print(pattern)  # Output:",7.47678542137146,0.08543250000000001,0.020423360784313727,7.476279258728027,2.0006428594174594e-06,0.02034358203125,49.15555178354967,256,0.0694396,5.207957,5.410183900000001,0.0159929,231,0.0694396,256,5.207957

Description are as below: There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:

2. Challenge 2: Extend Challenge 1. Now, the user can set an arbitrary sum and an arbitrary common ratio. The user also has the flexibility to specify the number of terms in the geometric progression. Handle exceptions where an improper ratio or term number is entered by a user.

In a recursive method, a ternary operator can be used to simplify the code by making it more concise and readable. Here's an example of using a ternary operator in a recursive Fibonacci sequence function written in JavaScript:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, a = 0, b = 1) {
  if (n === 1) return a;

  return fibonacci(n - 1, b, a + b); // recursive call with updated values for 'a' and 'b'

mistral:7b,31,0,2026-01-21T16:12:29.521985,"Can you elucidate the distinctions between mutable and immutable objects, specifically in terms of their modifiability and characteristics?",139,34,short,," Absolutely! Let's break it down:

1. Mutable Objects: These are objects that can be modified or changed after they have been created. In many programming languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, variables are mutable by default. For example, in Python, if you declare a list, you can add or remove elements from it, which means the list is mutable.

   Characteristics:
   - They can be changed after creation.
   - They occupy dynamic memory because their size can change during runtime.
   - They may lead to unpredictable behavior if not handled properly, such as in multi-threaded programming where multiple threads might try to modify the same mutable object simultaneously.

2. Immutable Objects: These are objects that cannot be modified after they have been created. Once an immutable object is created, it will always have the same value. In many languages like Python and Java, primitive data types (like integers, strings, and booleans) are immutable by default.

Here's a high-level plan for such an implementation, focusing on the principles you mentioned:

1. **Queue Principle**: A doubly linked list maintains the order of elements in a sequence while allowing additions and removals from both ends (front and rear). In our hash table-based deque, we'll use two separate hash tables for the front and rear pointers to maintain this property.

2. **Dictionary Principle**: Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs efficiently, where keys can represent node indices or pointers, and values can be the actual nodes. This allows us to quickly access and manipulate nodes based on their positions in the doubly linked list.

Now let's discuss some complexities and potential obstacles:

1. **Memory Management**: Each node will require memory for storing the key (index or pointer), value (data), and pointers to adjacent nodes (next and prev). Proper memory allocation is crucial to avoid fragmentation and ensure efficient use of resources.

An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. The lexicographically smallest path is the one that, when represented as a sequence of vertices, would come first in a lexicographical ordering.

Write a function `findLexicographicallySmallestEulerianPath(graph, start)` that takes in the following parameters:
- `graph`: a dictionary representing the directed graph, where the keys are vertices and the values are lists of vertices to which there is a directed edge from the key vertex.
- `start`: the starting vertex for the path.

The function should return a list representing the lexicographically smallest Eulerian path starting from the given vertex. If multiple Eulerian paths exist, return any one of them.

For example, given the graph:
```
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['C'],
    'C': ['A']
}
```
and the starting vertex `'A'`, the function should return `['A', 'B', 'C', 'A']`.",1093,273,very_long,," To find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian path in a given directed graph, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) with a backtracking approach.

Then, for each unique squared distance, we count the number of pairs that have this squared distance. The count of pairs will be twice the count of boomerangs with this squared distance because each boomerang contributes two pairs.

Here's a Python solution:

```python
def numberOfBoomerangs(points):
    n = len(points)
    if n < 3:
        return 0

    count = [0] * (20001)  # store squared distances

    for p1 in points:
        count[p1[0]**2 + p1[1]**2] += 1  # increment the counter for current point's distance

        for p2 in points:
            if p1 != p2:
                dist = (p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2
                count[dist] += ",7.51881217956543,0.0877597,0.020565540392156866,7.51881217956543,0.0,0.020485206250000002,48.815715487365416,256,0.0702661,5.244212800000001,5.457707500000001,0.0174936,338,0.0702661,256,5.244212800000001

If you exceed this limit, you should implement a back-off strategy to wait until you can make the next request.",527,131,long,," To achieve this task, I'll provide you with a Python script using Tweepy library for accessing the Twitter API and implementing the required features.

However, it's important to note that this operation can only be performed on a process that has not started execution yet or has been stopped (e.g., using ptrace).

When a process starts, its memory is mapped with the executable file. If you try to unmap these regions after the process has started, it will indeed segfault because those regions are essential for the program's execution.

The man page might not be clear about this, but it seems that what it suggests is to use this call during the process creation or when the process is stopped (for example, using ptrace).

```python
def find_palindromes(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = text.replace(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;)
    palindromes = []
    for i in range(len(text)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(text)):
            if text[i:j] == text[i:j][::-1]:
                palindromes.append(text[i:j])
    return palindromes
```

This code is unsuccessful in accurately identifying nested palindromes and non-alphanumeric characters. Your mission is to rectify these issues and augment the functionality of the subroutine as outlined above. You should also ensure that the subroutine meets the specified time and space complexity requirements.",1989,497,very_long,," To address the issues and enhance the functionality of the given code, I've created a new Python function called `find_palindromes()` that can identify palindromes, their positions, and frequency within a text, handle nested palindromes, disregard non-alphanumeric characters, and manage multiple paragraphs. The function also meets the specified time and space complexity requirements.

Here's the improved code:

```python
import re

def find_palindromes(text):
    # Remove punctuation and special symbols, convert to lowercase, and split into words
    text = re.sub('[^\w\s]', '', text).lower().split()

    palindromes = {}
    paragraphs = []
    start_index = 0
    current_paragraph = """"

    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i] == ' ':
            if current_paragraph:
                paragraphs.append(current_paragraph)
                current_paragraph = """"

The provided code snippet is a shell script that takes a folder name as an argument and then uses conda to build packages for all Python versions available in the system.

Your task is to write a Python script that achieves the same functionality as the given shell script. The script should accept a folder name as input and then execute the conda build command for all available Python versions.

Your Python script should:
1. Accept a folder name as a command-line argument.
2. Identify all available Python versions on the system.
3. Execute the conda build command for each Python version, using the specified folder as the source.

Assume that the conda command is available in the system and that the necessary permissions are in place to execute the conda build command.

Write a Python script that accomplishes the described functionality.",1083,270,very_long,," To achieve this, you can use the `subprocess` module in Python to execute shell commands.
