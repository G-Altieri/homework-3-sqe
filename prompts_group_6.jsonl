{"id": 78, "prompt": "Embellish the code for the ensuing function:\n\ndef select_phrases(s, n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Think about a scenario where you are provided with a string 's', along with two natural numbers 'n' and 'm'. Now, you are asked to formulate a function that returns a list which encapsulates all phrases found in the string 's' (Keep in mind that a phrase is constituted by a series of words separated by just one space) wherein the cumulative count of consonants across all the words within the phrase matches 'n' and the total tally of vowels aligns with 'm'. If two successive phrases share the identical total consonants 'n' and vowels 'm' values, then they have to be combined to form a single, innovative phrase. In the instance where the string 's' is devoid of any content, the function should return a vacant list. Following the merging of two phrases, it is obligatory to eradicate one consonant and one vowel, selected randomly, from the fused phrase. Important to note is the fact that the input string exclusively incorporates alphabets and spaces.\n    \n    Examples:\n    select_phrases(\"Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow\", 10, 9) \n    select_phrases(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", 11, 10)\n    select_phrases(\"Uncle sam is a man of sound constitutuion\", 9, 8)\n    select_phrases(\"Beautiful river flows over the green mossy hills\", 15, 13)\n    select_phrases(\"Alphabets are everywhere around us\", 20, 18)\n    \"\"\"\nYour new challenge requires devising original and pertinent examples to test the functionality of the aforementioned function."}
